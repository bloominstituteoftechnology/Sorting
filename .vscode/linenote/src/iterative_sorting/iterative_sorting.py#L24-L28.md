Bubble sort loops through an array (list) comparing
two indices normally the start of the array at index 0 and
index 1. If index 0 is greater than index 1 then these two indices
are swapped. This is done for all indices in the array which will sort the array
eventually bubbling the largest number to the end of the array. Bubble sort is considered
the slowest and most memory intensive way of sorting. NEVER USE IT!!
