# Complete the selection_sort() function below in class with your instructor

# First look through all the cards and find the smallest.
# then move the card to the correct positions in the dataset. Swap it with whatever is at the far left.
#repeat this sequence till things are done
# Look for the next smallest card.
# Don't have to look at the smallest.
# move it to the correct spot

    #         if the temp variable is larger. Then we stop. If it is less than, 
    #             We keep moving down until there is one that is less than. Or rather the temp variable is larger. than the one on the left.
    #             If the variable on the left is smaller, then we break the loop. Set a new temp and start over.
