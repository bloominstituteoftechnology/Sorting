# Quick Sort Algorithm
# 1. Select a pivot. Often times this is the first or last element in a set. It can also be the middle.
# 2. Move all elements smaller than the pivot to the left.
# 3. Move all elements greater than the pivot to the right.
# 4. While LHS and RHS are greater than 1, repeat steps 1-3 on each side.

# Algorithm
# 1. While your data set contains more than one item, split it in half
# 2. Once you have gotten down to a single element, you have also *sorted* that element
#    (a single element cannot be "out of order")
# 3. Start merging your single lists of one element together into larger, sorted sets
# 4. Repeat step 3 until the entire data set has been reassembled
# Below: A helper function that handles merging sorted pieces back together
def merge(arrA, arrB):
    elements = len(arrA) + len(arrB)
    merged_arr = [0] * elements
    # Given two arrays, combine into a sorted array
    # Compare the first element of each, add the smallest to the merged array
    # Iterate the pointer for the smaller value
    # If one pointer reaches the end of its array, push all remaining values in the other array to the end of merged
    # 4 possibilities, done with arrA, done with arrB, or not done and either is smaller
    a = 0
    b = 0
    # Since arrA/B are already sorted, prepare first element of each when merging
    for i in range(0, elements):
        if a >= len(arrA):  # All the elements in arrA have been merged
            merged_arr[i] = arrB[b]
            b += 1
        elif b >= len(arrB):  # All the elements in arrB have been merged
            merged_arr[i] = arrA[a]
            a += 1
        elif arrA[a] < arrB[b]:  # The next element in arrA if smaller add to the final array
            merged_arr[i] = arrA[a]
            a += 1
        else:  # The next element in arrB if smaller add to the final array
            merged_arr[i] = arrB[b]

# This function also handles the divide part
# Below: A recursive function that handles dividing the array (or subarray) in half
def merge_sort(arr):
    # Base case: stop dividing when the array cannot be divided any further
    # Otherwise, find the middle of the array with //2
    # Divide to left and right, then do merge sort on left and right (because this further divides)
    # Finally, put the arrays back together by merging left and right
